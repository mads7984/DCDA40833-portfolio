            <p>Welcome to my Skills Portfolio for DCDA 40833. This site showcases the work I've completed throughout the semester, demonstrating my growth in digital culture and data analytics! The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my versatility in a user friendly format. Additionally, my skills in these various applications will be accessible from a single site for convenience.</p>
            <p>Each page represents a different lab assignment, building from foundational web development skills to data visualization and interactive mapping.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <!-- TODO: Replace this placeholder content with information about yourself -->
            <!--It was really important to me that I tie my personal experience in pharmacy together with my passions in my introduction as a part of my "why"-->
            <p><strong>Who I am:</strong> My name is Madeline Gordy! I'm a junior Digital Culture & Data Analytics and Economics double major, and I'm from Aledo, TX! An interesting fact about me is that I'm a certified immunizer, and I administered over 400 vaccines last year! </p>
            <p><strong>My interests:</strong> I'm passionate about taking real world data to answer complicated questions, which drew me to the DCDA program. Working as a certified pharmacy technician the past 3 years, I'm very passionate about our healthcare system, and I love to explore topics surrounding pharmaceuticals such as pharmaceutical R&D and drug shortages. Health economics has become a new interest of mine because it bridges together my passion for healthcare and my passion for economics into one field of study.</p>
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong> I'm hoping to continue to build my skills in Python, AI/LLMs, GitHub, HTML, as well as gain new skills & confidence in areas & applications I'm unfamiliar with such as PowerBI, Natural Language Processing, CSS, and C++. I also hope to develop my skills in website and app development</p>

            <h2>Semester Reflection</h2>
            <!-- TODO: After completing all labs, write a reflection on your growth -->
            <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> I gained confidence integrating GitHub, HTML, and CSS to build a hosted website. While I had used GitHub for version control in academic writing, this project taught me how to apply it to web development, specifically, managing code, making commits, and maintaining a live portfolio. I also refreshed my CSS and web hosting skills, learning how to format a static website into life online.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges I overcame:</strong> I initially found it challenging to shift from a programming mindset (like Python) to the structure and styling of HTML and CSS. Re-engaging with web technologies I hadn't used since high school required patience and practice, but by steadily working through the project, I rebuilt my confidence and now have a functional portfolio to showcase my growing skill set.</p>
            <p><strong>How I grew:</strong> [How did your understanding of digital culture and data analytics evolve?]</p>
            <p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> [How will you apply these skills in the future?]</p>
