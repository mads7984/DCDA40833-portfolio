            <h2>Visualization Overview</h2>
            <p>I chose to look at the consumption of pharmaceuticals that treat cardiovascular diseases and the diet consumption of fruits and vegetables versus sugar for different countries. I collected the pharmaceutical consumption data from the OECD Data Explorer, and through their website I was able to refine my data selection to cardiovascular system drugs, OECD countries, and 2010-2024 data. I also collected data for diet consumption from a premade Kaggle dataset, which used data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to compile its information.  </p>

            <h2>Analysis & Reflection</h2>
            <p>When collecting my data, most of the data was already cleaned, filtered, and prepared for visualization when I downloaded it. I used Tableau Public to create a join between the FAOSTAT and the OECD data to isolate OECD country data and remove any null values. The FAOSTAT data did not include Slovak Republic and Turkey, so that data was excluded from the diet composition bar charts. For my designated measures of defined daily dose, diet composition of fruits and vegetables, and diet composition of sugar, I used the platform to convert the data measure to the average for each country.</p> 

            <p>For my design, I chose to create a choropleth map that visualizes the defined daily dose of cardiovascular system pharmaceuticals for each country. The defined daily dose is a measurement that was created by the World Health Organization that measures the average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults. The choropleth map was the most efficient way to illustrate differences between countries through the use of gradual colors. I also chose to create a bar graph which measures the average diet composition of fruits and vegetables as well as sugar for each country, measured in calories per person per day. The bar graph is a side-by-side comparison of the difference between the two compositions, separated by country, for maximum readability and to highlight the differences between the two compositions.</p> 

            <p>With my previous knowledge on the topic, I assumed that countries with a higher average sugar diet composition would have a higher defined daily dose for cardiovascular system pharmaceuticals. However, based on my visualization, there is not a clearly defined relationship between the two variables. I did consider that fruits and vegetables do have a sugar content, and the data did not specify whether the sugar content was from natural sugar, added sugars, or both, so I decided to test if there was a relationship between fruit and vegetable diet composition and defined daily dose. The visualization did not illustrate a clearly defined relationship between those two variables either. In both cases, I was extremely surprised because since I was a child, I’ve been told that less sugar and more fruits and vegetables are how you keep your heart healthy. After this investigation, I am interested in further investigating the given data and see if I can find an additional data set that narrows down what kinds of sugar make up the diet composition of sugar. I am also interested to see if there is a relationship between healthcare expenditure, defined daily dose, and the number of cardiovascular system related deaths to see if the relationship, or lack thereof, that I observed in this lab is a result of a missed diagnosis and the inability to seek medical care.</p>

            <p>Tableau Public is free to access and relatively user friendly with a lot of features and capabilities. The platform offers many kinds of visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, geographic maps, and interactive dashboards. Tableau Public is capable of powerful calculations through the platform, making it easy to edit your visualizations with the click of a button, which I found extremely helpful in finding the averages of daily defined dose and diet compositions. Dashboards are easy to make and customize with Tableau’s drag and drop features, allowing users to make effective visualizations to make large data sets into easily understandable visualizations. However, the user-friendly interface has a learning curve which can be frustrating to navigate at first. During my project I heavily relied on external forums to create various details such as a pop-up tab as I found Tableau’s community forums not helpful for what I was trying to accomplish. One downside to the platform is that Tableau Public does not allow for private projects, as everything must be published to the website to save your work. Additionally, workbooks are based on local files, meaning that to main up to date information, the platform requires manual updates and republishing. Collaboration is not possible in the platform, there are no features for multiple users to edit a dashboard, which could be a problem for larger projects where collaboration is necessary for timely completion, maximum efficiency, and accurate visualizations. Overall, Tableau Public is an effective tool for smaller visualization projects, but for larger projects I would choose a different visualization platform to utilize, even if a paid subscription was required.</p>
