            <h2>Key Code Snippet</h2>
            <p>Below is a key section of the AI-generated code with comments using the understanding spectrum:</p>
            
            <pre><code>
&lt;!-- Example structure for commented code --&gt;
&lt;!-- I understand the logic: This function toggles dark mode by switching CSS classes --&gt;
function toggleDarkMode() {
    // I wrote this: Added event listener for the button click
    document.body.classList.toggle('dark-mode');
    
    // I understand what it does but not how: This localStorage part saves preference
    // The syntax with JSON.stringify is still fuzzy to me
    localStorage.setItem('darkMode', document.body.classList.contains('dark-mode'));
}

// I don't understand this: The next section handles something with cookies?
// After asking AI to explain: Now I understand it's checking saved preferences on page load
            </code></pre>
            
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Comments reflect my honest understanding at each point in the code.</p>

            <h2>Critical Reflection</h2>
            
            <h3>Technical Understanding</h3>
            <p><strong>What code did the AI generate?</strong> Describe the feature/function in your own words...</p>
            
            <p><strong>How does it work?</strong> Explain the key logic or mechanisms. Where did you land on the understanding spectrum? If there are parts you still don't fully understand after trying, say so...</p>
            
            <p><strong>What did you modify?</strong> Did you need to fix bugs, adjust styling, or change functionality? Why?...</p>

            <h3>Process Evaluation</h3>
            <p><strong>When was AI helpful?</strong> What tasks did it accelerate or simplify?...</p>
            
            <p><strong>When was AI problematic?</strong> Where did it produce incorrect, inefficient, or unnecessarily complex code?...</p>
            
            <p><strong>What's your role?</strong> In an AI-assisted workflow, what remains uniquely human? What can't (or shouldn't) be automated?...</p>

            <h3>Ethical & Pedagogical Considerations</h3>
            <p><strong>Learning trade-offs:</strong> Does vibe coding help or hinder your development as a programmer? Under what conditions?...</p>
            
            <p><strong>Attribution:</strong> When using AI-generated code, what does proper citation look like? (Consider academic vs. professional contexts)...</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your guidelines:</strong> What personal rules will you follow for using AI in coding? When will you use it? When won't you?...</p>

            <h2>Vibe Coding Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Based on this experiment, here are my personal guidelines for when and how to use AI in development:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>I will use AI when:</strong> [List situations where AI is appropriate]</li>
                <li><strong>I will not use AI when:</strong> [List situations where you'll avoid AI]</li>
                <li><strong>I will always:</strong> [List non-negotiable practices like commenting, testing, etc.]</li>
            </ul>
