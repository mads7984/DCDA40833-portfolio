            <h2>Tool 1: Consensus</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Consensus AI is an AI search engine that searches through scientific research and academic papers to answer research questions. Consensus is very user friendly; it has a similar interface to ChatGPT or Copilot, which allows users to simply input their research question, and the tool does the rest, providing organized and easily understandable information. Citations are placed next to the information it is citing, and users can easily find and follow the link to further examine the document. Since outputs are presented through easily understandable consensuses to any research question, not all questions can be answered in one output, but the platform makes it very easy to ask follow up questions, which can then be answered by the tool. Answers rely on what is available in the research data and AI algorithms, so it is possible the platform can miss relevant research or misclassify results. This can lead to gaps or inaccuracies in its summaries and consensus metrics. The main function of Consensus is to present real, objective evidence, so the platform struggles to answer any questions that are inherently subjective or value based. The platform will present the evidence from available literature, but ultimately, it will not make a final subjective decision. For example, when the platform was asked to whether economic growth or environmental conservation should be prioritized, Consensus concluded that they should be pursued together. </p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>Consensus AI would be a helpful tool for students that are starting a research project and need to find relevant sources to include in their research. While Consensus does provide summaries of the articles, it would be most beneficial for students to use the sources the tool pulls from their internet to start their research. Continued exploration of sources provided by the tool is crucial in ensuring full understanding of the text and its application in the context of the research. A poor use case of this tool would be to use the tool to search for medical, legal, or financial advice. While the tool can pull general findings from different sources, it cannot and should not apply them to a personal, actionable context.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>While Consensus AI is portrayed as an objective, helpful research tool, there are still ethical implications that must be acknowledged as responsible users of the platform. The name of the tool itself implies a contended and settled conclusion and simplified yes, or no outputs dismiss legitimate academic disagreement, minority viewpoints, and the provisional nature of science. Various biases are present in its inputs and algorithms, such as publication bias, database bias, and historical bias, which are further portrayed in its outputs. The platform includes a blanket statement, “Ranking [number] of papers by relevance to your initial query, considering factors like influence, recency, strength of evidence, and overall research quality.” But a lack of transparency in how each cited source is weighted in the synthesis process further amplifies the problem of bias and makes it difficult for users to audit the AI’s reasoning. </p>
