            <h2>Critique</h2>
            
            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>The infographic itself sends a hopeful message, that it costs little to nothing to improve the health of lower-income countries while simultaneously boosting the economy. The graphic is simple; the circles comparing the dollar amount invested to direct and indirect savings are proportional to their stated amount. $1 invested in lower-income countries for vaccines results in $16 of direct savings, and $44 of indirect savings. It’s easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to spark hope because if it’s only one dollar, surely, it can be done! Lower-income countries can be saved from preventable diseases!</p>
                
            <p>The unfortunate truth, however, is that it’s not that simple.</p>

            <h3>Overreaching</h3>
            <p>Beyond the immediate glimmer of hope, there must be critical consideration about the components of these claims, which are far overreached by the graphic. Lower-income countries typically lack the appropriate infrastructure to support vaccine supply chains. There’s a lack of cold chain capacity, transportation methods, data systems, and trained professionals. Without these infrastructures, vaccines are unable to be kept within their required temperature ranges throughout transport into harder to reach communities, record keeping remains difficult, and health complications can arise from incorrectly being administered a vaccine by someone who is not a trained professional. The graphic’s promise of massive “indirect savings” therefore overreaches by presenting a final benefit as a simple certainty, while dismissing the significant prerequisite investments and operational complexities that serves as the actual causes for any potential return.</p>

            <h3>Cherry-Picking</h3>
            <p>Blind optimism regarding this issue fails to address the inequity lower-income countries battle when trying to access vaccines. Vaccine distribution in the world is very unequal, with lower income countries at a disadvantage. These countries receive vaccines months later and in much smaller quantities due to weaker purchasing power and dependence on vaccine donations. The “savior complex” that this graphic imposes also fails to acknowledge the sentiments of the communities within these lower income countries. Lack of education, fears about side effects, low perceived disease risk, misinformation, and mistrust in government or foreign actors reduce vaccine uptake in lower-income countries. Vaccine nationalism also plays a crucial role, which argues that people’s willingness to take a vaccine is a function of the vaccine's origin. People are more likely to take a vaccine developed/manufactured within the national boarders over vaccines developed/manufactured abroad, further amplifying mistrust between foreign actors in combination with the lack of infrastructure in lower-income countries that would allow for vaccines to be manufactured within the country’s borders. The graphic cherry-picks about the optimistic outcome of this investment while omitting the problematic inputs and processes that determine whether that outcome is even achievable.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>While I do believe the intentions of this graphic were pure, with the goal of advocating for vaccine access in lower-income countries, the optimistic outcome is oversimplified and fails to address the issue’s complex root causes. Critical questions remain unasked: How much are the indirect savings decreased by if we must build up the above-named systems to effectively distribute and administer vaccines to these lower income countries? How long would it take for them to build that infrastructure, find the labor, and address inequalities in vaccine distribution in the world? The graphic shares a power message, but without an appropriate channel for the audience to contribute to this cause, it begs the question of who the intended audience is supposed to be. Who is investing the $1? Governments? Donors? Citizens? With the link between awareness and agency being broken, the graphic ultimately leaves the viewer with a passive, unresolved question: “Well, what am I supposed to do about it?”</p>
