            <h2>Tool 1: Consensus</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Consensus AI is an AI search engine that searches through scientific research and academic papers to answer research questions. Consensus is very user friendly; it has a similar interface to ChatGPT or Copilot, which allows users to simply input their research question, and the tool does the rest, providing organized and easily understandable information. Citations are placed next to the information it is citing, and users can easily find and follow the link to further examine the document. Since outputs are presented through easily understandable consensuses to any research question, not all questions can be answered in one output, but the platform makes it very easy to ask follow up questions, which can then be answered by the tool. Answers rely on what is available in the research data and AI algorithms, so it is possible the platform can miss relevant research or misclassify results. This can lead to gaps or inaccuracies in its summaries and consensus metrics. The main function of Consensus is to present real, objective evidence, so the platform struggles to answer any questions that are inherently subjective or value based. The platform will present the evidence from available literature, but ultimately, it will not make a final subjective decision. For example, when the platform was asked to whether economic growth or environmental conservation should be prioritized, Consensus concluded that they should be pursued together. </p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>Consensus AI would be a helpful tool for students that are starting a research project and need to find relevant sources to include in their research. While Consensus does provide summaries of the articles, it would be most beneficial for students to use the sources the tool pulls from their internet to start their research. Continued exploration of sources provided by the tool is crucial in ensuring full understanding of the text and its application in the context of the research. A poor use case of this tool would be to use the tool to search for medical, legal, or financial advice. While the tool can pull general findings from different sources, it cannot and should not apply them to a personal, actionable context.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>While Consensus AI is portrayed as an objective, helpful research tool, there are still ethical implications that must be acknowledged as responsible users of the platform. The name of the tool itself implies a contended and settled conclusion and simplified yes, or no outputs dismiss legitimate academic disagreement, minority viewpoints, and the provisional nature of science. Various biases are present in its inputs and algorithms, such as publication bias, database bias, and historical bias, which are further portrayed in its outputs. The platform includes a blanket statement, “Ranking [number] of papers by relevance to your initial query, considering factors like influence, recency, strength of evidence, and overall research quality.” But a lack of transparency in how each cited source is weighted in the synthesis process further amplifies the problem of bias and makes it difficult for users to audit the AI’s reasoning. </p>

            <h2>Tool 2: Claude</h2>
            <!-- Same structure as Tool 1 -->
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Claude is an AI chat bot designed to assist with tasks such as writing, coding, and information retrieval. When testing its capabilities, the model transparently states the steps it took to produce the given output, helping users see where the information used to generate the response came from and allows further exploration of cited sources. Claude’s capabilities are especially good at document processing, complex reasoning, problem solving, and technical writing. When given a multi-page document with specified page numbers, the model was able to analyze the text and provide main themes, key insights, and analytical observations. Whenever presented with a complex logic puzzle, the tool was able to break down the question, carefully analyze each piece of information provided in the question, and come to a conclusion, accompanied by a step-by-step solution. However, drawback to the model is that the free version of Claude, which uses Sonnet 4.5, has a knowledge cutoff date of January 2025, so it must do a manual search for the information requested versus using the data it was trained with. </p>

            </figure>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>Claude could effectively be used as a research assistant to analyze multiple long documents and papers. With the ability to process up to 100,000 tokens, or approximately 75,000 words, in a single conversation, Claude is ideal for tasks that require deep contextual understanding of lengthy documents or books. However, Claude would not be useful as a real-time news source, as its knowledge cutoff is January 2025. Although the model can search the web for information to answer questions about events after the knowledge cutoff date, outputs may exclude relevant context, include misinformation and low-quality sources, and overall may not match the quality of output about events within the knowledge cutoff date.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Anthropic, the AI company that owns Claude, recently launched Claude’s new constitution at the World Economic Forum’s Davos Summit. The principles of the new constitution are that Claude should be “broadly safe” (not undermining human oversight), “broadly ethical” (honest, avoiding inappropriate, dangerous, or harmful actions), “genuinely helpful” (benefitting its users), as well as being “compliant with Anthropic’s guidelines”. Comparatively, the new constitution shifts from the previously rule-based AI alignment to a reason-based one, explaining the logic behind ethical principles versus outlining specific authorized behaviors. However, the new constitution does have drawbacks. The constitution will likely need revisions as AI advances and becomes capable of sophisticated deception, and if the model detects it’s being tested, it may only perform compliance rather than genuinely adopting the ethical principles outlined in the constitution. Although this constitutional approach may work now, as AI systems approach or exceed human-level reasoning, this framework may fail, another limitation of reason-based AI alignment.</p>
